I want to create a flow diagram for transaction posting for my corebanking app. The flow I am thinking is corebanking will consist of 2 engine, core engine and custom engine. Core engine refers to the block which only handle the core functionality which is common for any financial transactions and which is followed by all banks accross all countries. On top of it I want to create an custom engine which specifically handles the use case of my bank in my country. For my bank in other country only this custom engine will require change. the flow would be to have a global api named gapi sitting on top. GAPI will recieve request from channel or interfacing system and it will convert it into corebanking request format. Then it will call corebanking api. Call will be recieved at service which will call sutom engine or core engine based on whether the processing is required at core feature or the custom layer which is country specific. design this api for me. also lets only focus on logic and not code. now i have 4 steps 1) Field validation or pre processing validation which will be done at both core and custom and then business rule validation or during posting transaction which also need to be done at both core and custom engine then we have transaction posting which will be done at core engine and last we have post processing which will be done at custom engine . how to design this

GPT-4.5
Here's a clear, structured flow diagram and logical design for your Core Banking transaction posting process, following the architecture you've described. This approach clearly separates the responsibilities between the Core Engine and Custom Engine.

Logical Design Overview:
Components:
GAPI (Global API): Entry point, receives requests from channels/interfacing systems, converts requests into the Core Banking format.
Core Banking API (Service Layer): Receives requests from GAPI, routes requests to either Core or Custom Engine based on the transaction processing step.
Core Engine: Handles standard, universal banking functionalities.
Custom Engine: Handles country-specific or bank-specific customizations.

Detailed Logical Steps:
Step 1: Pre-processing Validation
Custom Engine: Performs validation specific to the bank or country (e.g., local regulatory compliance, custom fields validation).
Core Engine: Performs universal field validation (e.g., account number format, mandatory fields, basic transaction structure).
Step 2: Business Rule Validation (During Posting)
Custom Engine: Applies bank or country-specific business rules (e.g., local limits, currency-specific rules, tax implications).
Core Engine: Applies universal banking rules (e.g., sufficient balance checks, authorization rules, transaction duplication checks).
Step 3: Transaction Posting
Core Engine: Executes the standard posting logic (e.g., debit/credit accounts, balances update, ledger entries, audit logging).
Step 4: Post-processing
Custom Engine: Handles custom post-processing logic (e.g., sending notifications, country-specific reporting, regulatory reporting, additional logging).
Key Design Principles:
Separation of Concerns: Clearly distinguishes between core banking logic and custom logic.
Scalability: Easy to extend or modify custom engine without affecting core functionality.
Maintainability: Changes in country-specific requirements are isolated in the Custom Engine, making it easy to maintain and update.
Reusability: Core Engine functionality remains consistent and reusable across multiple countries.
API Design (Logical Structure):
GAPI Endpoint (Logical):
Copy
POST /gapi/transaction
{
  "channelRequest": {
    // channel-specific fields
  }
}
Core Banking API (Logical):
Copy
POST /corebanking/transaction
{
  "transactionRequest": {
    // standard core banking fields
    // custom metadata for custom engine processing
  }
}
Routing Logic (Service Layer):
Copy
if step == PRE_PROCESSING_VALIDATION:
    execute CoreEngine.preProcessingValidation()
    execute CustomEngine.preProcessingValidation()

if step == BUSINESS_RULE_VALIDATION:
    execute CoreEngine.businessRuleValidation()
    execute CustomEngine.businessRuleValidation()

if step == TRANSACTION_POSTING:
    execute CoreEngine.transactionPosting()

if step == POST_PROCESSING:
    execute CustomEngine.postProcessing()
Benefits of this Approach:
Clear separation between core and custom logic.
Custom Engine can easily adapt to changing local regulations.
Core Engine remains stable, secure, and standardized.
Simplified testing and deployment due to modular separation.
This design ensures your core banking system is robust, flexible, and adaptable to various banking regulations and requirements across multiple countries.

can 
execute CoreEngine.preProcessingValidation()
    execute CustomEngine.preProcessingValidation()

and 
execute CoreEngine.businessRuleValidation()
    execute CustomEngine.businessRuleValidation()
run parallely

GPT-4.5
Yes, absolutely. The validations at the Core Engine and Custom Engine (both Pre-processing Validation and Business Rule Validation) can and ideally should run in parallel to optimize performance and reduce overall processing time.

Since these two validations (Core and Custom) are independent of each other, parallel execution is recommended.

Here's an updated Mermaid Sequence Diagram clearly illustrating parallel execution:

parallel {
    CoreEngine.preProcessingValidation()
    CustomEngine.preProcessingValidation()

    CustomEngine.businessRuleValidation()
}

// Transaction Posting (sequential execution)
CoreEngine.transactionPosting()

// Post-processing (sequential execution)
CustomEngine.postProcessing()
Benefits of Parallel Execution:
Improved Throughput: Parallel execution reduces transaction processing time.
Enhanced Efficiency: Independent validations do not block each other.
Scalability: Easier to scale horizontally by adding resources to each engine.
Thus, running these validation steps in parallel is not only feasible but also recommended for better performance and scalability.

can you keep  participant API as Core Banking API (Service Layer)

Improved Mermaid Sequence Diagram:
Copy

Explanation of Best Practices Applied:
1. Logical Encapsulation:
Core Banking API (Service Layer) is shown as a logical container clearly encapsulating the Core Engine and Custom Engine. This approach aligns with modularity and encapsulation principles, making the architecture easy to understand and maintain.
2. Parallel Execution:
Clearly indicates parallel execution blocks (par) for independent validations (pre-processing and business rule validations), which is a common industry practice for performance optimization.
3. Sequential Clarity:
Clearly identifies sequential steps (transaction posting followed by post-processing), maintaining logical correctness and transactional integrity.
4. Clear Separation of Concerns:
Clearly separates core functionality (universal banking logic) from custom functionality (bank-specific or country-specific logic), aligning closely with industry-standard modular architecture.
5. Color Coding:
Added subtle color coding to visually distinguish different processing phases, improving readability and clarity.
This improved diagram clearly visualizes your desired architecture, aligns with best industry practices, and provides clarity for development, testing, and maintenance.

looks like all 4 color got overlapped and reached to gapi also. ideally it should only be in the API as Core Banking API (Service Layer). also there might be some transformation required at custom engine also before sending to core engine for posting so that the cutom added can also be stored in transaction/account table

GPT-4.5
You're correct. Let's refine the Mermaid sequence diagram to clearly represent the following improvements:

Color-coded blocks should only be within the Core Banking API (Service Layer) box.
Clearly depict the Custom Engine performing transformations before sending data to the Core Engine for transaction posting.
Ensure GAPI and Channel interactions are outside the colored boxes.

Explanation of Improvements:
Encapsulation: All internal processing (validations, transformations, posting, and post-processing) is encapsulated within the Core Banking API (Service Layer) clearly.
Color Blocks Scope: Clearly limited within the Core Banking API box, improving readability.
Transformation and Enrichment Step: Explicitly added a step where the Custom Engine transforms/enriches the transaction request before forwarding it to the Core Engine for posting. This ensures custom data is correctly integrated into the transaction/account tables.
Clear Interaction Boundaries: GAPI and Channel interactions are clearly outside the colored internal processing blocks, emphasizing their roles as external interfaces.
Logical Flow (Pseudo-code for clarity):
Copy
// Parallel Pre-processing Validation
parallel {
    CoreEngine.preProcessingValidation()
    CustomEngine.preProcessingValidation()
}

// Parallel Business Rule Validation
parallel {
    CoreEngine.businessRuleValidation()
    CustomEngine.businessRuleValidation()
}

// Custom Transformation & Enrichment before Posting
transformedRequest = CustomEngine.transformAndEnrich(request)

// Transaction Posting (using transformed request)
postingResult = CoreEngine.transactionPosting(transformedRequest)

// Post-processing after Posting
CustomEngine.postProcessing(postingResult)
This updated sequence diagram clearly communicates the intended architecture, aligns with best practices, and accurately represents your requirement for custom transformations before transaction posting.

GPT-4.5
The Mermaid syntax error you're encountering is because Mermaid requires that the rect blocks and parallel (par) blocks must be placed between participants interactions, not directly after participants declaration. Also, Mermaid doesn't allow starting a rect or par block immediately after participants are declared without an interaction line or a note.

✅ Why the error occurred:
Mermaid syntax rules require at least one interaction between participants after declaration and before starting a rect or par block.
The original code directly started a rect block right after participant declarations, which Mermaid does not allow.
✅ What changed in the corrected diagram:
Added a simple interaction (Core->>Custom: Start Processing) immediately after participant declaration within the box to comply with Mermaid's rules.
Each rect block is self-contained and properly terminated with end.
Color blocks strictly remain within the "Core Banking API (Service Layer)" box as requested.
This corrected diagram is syntactically valid and accurately reflects your requirements.
